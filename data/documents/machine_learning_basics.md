# Machine Learning Basics

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model is trained on a dataset where the correct answers are already known, and it learns to predict outputs from inputs.

**Common algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find patterns and structures in the data without being explicitly told what to look for.

**Common algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Association Rules

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is about training an agent to make decisions by rewarding desired behaviors and punishing undesired ones.

**Key concepts:**
- Agent
- Environment
- State
- Action
- Reward

## Key Concepts

### Training and Testing
- **Training Set**: Used to train the model
- **Validation Set**: Used to tune hyperparameters
- **Test Set**: Used to evaluate the final model

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple and performs poorly on both training and test data

### Feature Engineering
The process of selecting and transforming variables to improve model performance.

## Popular ML Libraries

- **scikit-learn**: General-purpose ML library for Python
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework by Google
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework by Facebook
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API

## Conclusion

Machine learning is a powerful tool that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.
